        <h3>Part1 La gazza ladra</h3>
        <p>She is so convinced, and the fact is indeed so. 
            In order to repair her relationship with Lihua, Niaogu Jingliu created a fake Magpie vase with the help of the paintings and materials used by Shaxi to deceive Kenichiro Asahara back then, as well as her constantly honed ceramic skills. 
            At the same time, she also left behind a Bi Fei that could serve as proof of the fake. However, when Jingliu truly brought the vase to Lihua, 
            she wavered: Lihua, who had the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood, not only did not recognize it as a fake, but she was very happy to firmly believe it was genuine. 
            However, Jingliu had a guilty conscience and took back the magpie vase.</p>

        <h3>Part2 картинки с выставки</h3>
        <p>The second chapter is filled with a "plain" teacher's daily life, as if telling players that the current Hayashi Naoya is not an excellent artist, but an excellent teacher.
            A whole chapter is depicting this beautiful and comfortable daily life, which makes me feel that such a simple life is really beautiful. It doesn't matter whether it's fame or fortune, nor does it matter whether it's infighting. Why not guard the hopeful art department and witness their growth.
            But Naoya still couldn't let go of his deceased friend in his heart, mapping his shadow to some corners of life, constantly urging him to move towards a higher point; At the same time, other people are also moving forward around him: a bit more stable than before, Nagayama Chanai, the new generation of art department members, the scallops who have become social animals but still call Grass Shave drinking, the blue like family... everyone is changing and advancing, but as a teacher, Grass Shave seems to have stayed on the day Gui died.</p>

        <h3>Part3 Genius and Talent </h3>
        <p>In this chapter, I believe that the character of Etienne is worth mentioning. The phrase 'ordinary genius shows talent, real genius makes people forget talent' runs through every corner from 'Poetry' to 'Carving'. The concept of "true genius" is more presented in "Poetry", but the concept of "ordinary genius" is also explained in detail in "Carving", and Etienne is such a character. Ning, who was born with four color vision and was able to integrate this ability well into her own painting, is undoubtedly a genius. However, she overly relies on this ability, constantly puts in effort and practice on her "talent", and reaches the pinnacle of her talent, which leads to her even less being able to discover the essence of art: works that move people's hearts are good works.</p>
