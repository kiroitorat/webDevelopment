    <p class="Chapter_text"><em>She is so convinced, and the fact is indeed so. 
        In order to repair her relationship with Lihua, Niaogu Jingliu created a fake Magpie vase with the help of the paintings and materials used by Shaxi to deceive Kenichiro Asahara back then, as well as her constantly honed ceramic skills. 
        At the same time, she also left behind a Bi Fei that could serve as proof of the fake. However, when Jingliu truly brought the vase to Lihua, 
        she wavered: Lihua, who had the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood, not only did not recognize it as a fake, but she was very happy to firmly believe it was genuine. 
        However, Jingliu had a guilty conscience and took back the magpie vase.</em></p>
