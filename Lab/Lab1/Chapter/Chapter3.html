    <p class="Chapter_text"><em>In this chapter, I believe that the character of Etienne is worth mentioning. The phrase 'ordinary genius shows talent, real genius makes people forget talent' runs through every corner from 'Poetry' to 'Carving'. The concept of "true genius" is more presented in "Poetry", but the concept of "ordinary genius" is also explained in detail in "Carving", and Etienne is such a character. Ning, who was born with four color vision and was able to integrate this ability well into her own painting, is undoubtedly a genius. However, she overly relies on this ability, constantly puts in effort and practice on her "talent", and reaches the pinnacle of her talent, which leads to her even less being able to discover the essence of art: works that move people's hearts are good works.</em></p>
