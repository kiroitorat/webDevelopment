    <p class="Chapter_text" style="margin: 50px;"><em>The second chapter is filled with a "plain" teacher's daily life, as if telling players that the current Hayashi Naoya is not an excellent artist, but an excellent teacher.
        A whole chapter is depicting this beautiful and comfortable daily life, which makes me feel that such a simple life is really beautiful. It doesn't matter whether it's fame or fortune, nor does it matter whether it's infighting. Why not guard the hopeful art department and witness their growth.
        But Naoya still couldn't let go of his deceased friend in his heart, mapping his shadow to some corners of life, constantly urging him to move towards a higher point; At the same time, other people are also moving forward around him: a bit more stable than before, Nagayama Chanai, the new generation of art department members, the scallops who have become social animals but still call Grass Shave drinking, the blue like family... everyone is changing and advancing, but as a teacher, Grass Shave seems to have stayed on the day Gui died.</em></p>
